# jetkvm_control

**jetkvm_control** is a Rust client/server/library for interacting with JetKVM devices using WebRTC and JSONâ€‘RPC. It provides functionality to authenticate with a JetKVM device, set up a WebRTC PeerConnection with a DataChannel, and send various input events (keyboard and mouse) as well as receive notifications (such as screen resolution updates) from the device.


> **Note:** Starting with version **0.1.4 (2025-03-09)**, a new secure RPC server (**jetkvm_control_svr**) has been introduced. This server supports TLS encryption and HMAC authentication, and includes features such as active_window and active_process interrogation.  The server is cross-platform.  The `jetkvm_control_svr` may be used without a JetKVM device.  It comes with a rust client and Lua bindings.


## Features

- **Keyboard Input:** Functions for sending keyboard events including text, control combinations (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-X, etc.), and special keys (Return, Windows key, etc.).
- **Mouse Control:** Functions for absolute mouse movement, clicks (left, right, middle), double-click, and click-and-drag actions.
- **jetkvm_control_svr:** to monitor processes and windows during script execution.

## Installation

1. **Install via cargo**
   ```
   cargo install jetkvm_control
   ```

   - or - 

   **Clone the Repository**
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/davehorner/jetkvm_control.git
      cd jetkvm_control
      ```

2. **Configure Your Settings**

    The project reads its configuration from either a jetkvm_control.toml file.
    Run the following command to edit/create jetkvm_control.toml files.
     ```bash
     cargo run -- -c
        -or-   
     jetkvm_control -c
     ```

    You can override values via the command-line.

3. **Running the Project**
    After setting up your configuration, you can build and run the project with Cargo:
     ```bash
     cargo run -- -H 192.168.1.100 lua-examples/windows-notepad-helloworld.lua
     ```

    This will compile the project and execute the window-notepad-helloworld.lua example.
  
## About the cmdline client

The client (cargo run/jetkvm_control) is a simple ping if you don't have the `lua` feature enabled.

If you enable the lua feature; jetkvm_control will expect a lua file to execute.

```
A control client for JetKVM over WebRTC.

Usage: jetkvm_control [OPTIONS] <LUA_SCRIPT>

Arguments:
  <LUA_SCRIPT>  Path to the Lua script to execute

Options:
  -H, --host <HOST>          The host address to connect to
  -p, --port <PORT>          The port number to use
  -a, --api <API>            The API endpoint
  -P, --password <PASSWORD>  The password for authentication
  -v, --verbose              Enable verbose logging (include logs from webrtc_sctp)
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```

## What's the code look like

The api is subject to change.   This project adheres to the "Semantic Versioning" standard.

example code for rust:
```rust
let config = JetKvmConfig::load()?;
let mut client = JetKvmRpcClient::new(config);

if let Err(err) = client.connect().await {
    error!("Failed to connect to RPC server: {:?}", err);
    std::process::exit(1);
}
// open notepad and say Hello World, copy and paste.
send_windows_key(&client).await.ok();
sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
rpc_sendtext(&client, "notepad").await.ok();
sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
send_return(&client).await.ok();
sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
rpc_sendtext(&client, "Hello World").await.ok();
sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
send_ctrl_a(&client).await.ok();
sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
send_ctrl_x(&client).await.ok();
sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
send_ctrl_v(&client).await.ok();
sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
send_return(&client).await.ok();
sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
send_ctrl_v(&client).await.ok();
```

example code in lua:
```lua
print("Executing Lua script...")
send_windows_key()
delay(550)
send_text("notepad")
send_return()
delay(250)
delay(250)
send_text("Hello World!")
send_ctrl_a()
send_ctrl_c()
delay(250)
send_ctrl_v()
delay(250)
send_ctrl_v()
send_key_combinations({
    { modifier = 0x04, keys = {0x3D}, hold = 100, wait = 1000 }, -- Alt+F4
    { modifier = 0, keys = {0x4F}, wait = 250 }, -- Right arrow
    { modifier = 0, keys = {0x28} },  -- Return (Enter)
})
```
